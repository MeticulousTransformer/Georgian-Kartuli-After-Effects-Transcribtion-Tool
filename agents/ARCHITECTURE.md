The modern panel uses **CEP**, because ScriptUI cannot host a modern animated
canvas. The original ScriptUI panel remains in the runtime and shares the same
renderer and new title registry. Nothing routes transcription through AE.

The studio exposes every original visual setting, checked against ScriptUI's
`gatherSettings()` in the panel tests. Keep new controls in that parity check.
`word_styles.js` is generated from `ae/lib/style_shuffle.jsx`; edit the AE source
and run `python scripts/sync_preview_styles.py`. Release packaging regenerates
it automatically. Preview and AE use the same seeded shuffle algorithm.

Data flow:

1. AE chooses a source media path. The panel posts it to the loopback service.
2. The service extracts audio into `exports/runs/<uuid>/`, runs the selected
   adapter, normalizes words, and groups captions. Raw and normalized JSON are saved.
3. The panel validates the result. The preview and editor use that document.
4. Text edits change `text/isEdited` and caption text; timings stay intact.
5. Generate passes validated JSON and normalized settings to `KCF_dispatch`.
6. The existing layer builder measures text, creates a fresh precomp, and calls
   the registered preset's hooks. The original composition receives one precomp layer.

Installed location:

- Windows runtime: `%LOCALAPPDATA%/CapForge`.
- macOS runtime: `~/Library/Application Support/CapForge`.
- An owned earlier `Kartuli Caption Forge` runtime stays in its original path.
  Marker and saved-look readers accept both product names. Public branding is CapForge.
- `.runtime/` contains CapForge's private uv tools and managed Python. The
  bootstrap never modifies system PATH or registers Python globally. The venv
  gets a bundled audio binary through `imageio-ffmpeg`; no ffmpeg setup is required.
- CEP panel: the user's Adobe CEP `extensions/com.kartuli.captionforge` folder.
- `install.json` contains a runtime path, **never** an API key or auth token.
- `.venv/`, `exports/`, backend key files and `.local-token` survive updates.
- A runtime copy of `installer/` and `panel/` lets users repair from the app folder.
- Older code/panel copies are backed up under the runtime's `backups/` folder.
- The preview package is unsigned; the optional debug-mode setting applies to
  all unsigned Adobe extensions for that user. Sign the production package.

Security boundaries:

- Service binds to `127.0.0.1`. Only loopback Host headers are accepted.
- Readiness is public; other endpoints require a random installation token.
- CEP file origins `null` and `file://` are accepted with token authentication. Web origins are denied.
- API keys stay in the service's local `.env`; saved looks allowlist visual settings.
- Strings cross into AE as JSON, not source code. User text is DOM `textContent`
  or Canvas text, never `innerHTML`.
- Title files are trusted installed code. Do not build a UI that executes uploaded JSX.
- Local `.env` files are plaintext; owner-only permissions are used on POSIX.
  OS credential-vault storage remains a release improvement, not a claimed feature.
